I am exploring how to build intelligent AI systems that enable enhanced human-AI collaboration to better aid people in achieving their goals. In particular, my research interests involve developing adaptive systems that are personalized to best align with a user's goal.

I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute advised by Prof. Mohammad Amiri and Prof. Tomek Strzalkowski. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto.
