I am exploring how to build intelligent AI systems that enable enhanced human-AI collaboration to better aid people in achieving their goals. In particular, my research interests involve developing adaptive systems that are personalized to best align with a user's goal. I am currently a PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute supervised by Prof. Mohammad Amiri and Prof. Tomek Strzalkowski. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, and completed my bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the same institution.
