title: "Judging facts, judging norms: Training machine learning models to judge humans requires a modified approach to labeling data"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-judging-facts
excerpt: 'We find that using factual labels to train models intended for normative judgments introduces a notable measurement error and models trained using factual labels yield significantly different judgments than those trained using
normative labels such that the impact of this effect on model performance can exceed that of other factors (e.g.,
dataset size) that routinely attract attention from ML researchers and practitioners.'
